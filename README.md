Hi,
I am Arhan Das, the creator of the Project El Pensador, an AI chatbot that will help one in their daily tasks such as coding, creative content, speech, visuals, etc. 
The project is currently in development and there are still a lot of things to implement in it.
You can however, test the alpha version, but only on desktop scaling, the project is not yet responsive for smaller screens.
Any suggestions to improvement is highly appreciated.
Thank you!
